# Maaslin2 package demonstration. Multifactorial linear regression analysis
An easy way to automatize downstream 16S-rRNA or other type of microorganism sequensing data analysis yielding significant associations between patient parameters and taxa abundance
https://iosinnii.github.io/Maaslin2-demo/R/analysis-maaslin2.html - this report demonstrates how to use the package based on a mock data 
## Input
We use mock data: input_bacteria.csv - normalized bacterial abundance 
input_metadata.csv - metadata from patients
## Output
typical Maaslin2 output format. folders contain .csv files with taxa ranking and statistics and figures for significant hits
## Assets
manually extracted figures for incorporation into Quatro report
## R
maaslin2-analysis.qmd contains all code and comments to describe this analysis
